## Usage

`@research-plan.md`

## Context

- Basic information of the project: `docs/01-basic-information.md`
- Processed data analysis: `docs/04-processed-data-analysis.md`
- Processed data stored in `data/processed/`

## Process

1. Read the basic information of the project: `docs/01-basic-information.md`
2. Read the processed data analysis: `docs/04-processed-data-analysis.md`
3. Based on the project objectives and processed data, design comprehensive research plan including:
   - Feature engineering strategy
   - Analysis methods and/or model selection
